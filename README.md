# GLearnPlatform 🎮📚

GLearnPlatform is a gamified e-learning platform that motivates students using XP points, badges, and leaderboard ranking.

Frontend is built using React.js and organized using component-based architecture.

This repository currently contains the client-side (frontend) implementation. Backend using Node.js and MongoDB will be added in future.
